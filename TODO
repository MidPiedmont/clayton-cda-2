In the client-old iteration, I've removed CRA and replaced with Vite,
    and I've also gotten rid of a shitload of deps, breaking the whole damn project

I'm thinking that the move is to: 
1. trash this version, 
2. copy over a fresh copy of the old, 
3a*. start coding the whole app from scratch
OR
3b*. Strip unnecessary deps, update deps that can be updated, and start replacing nextui compenents in-place with shadcn components
*No preference, maybe flip a coin?
    Flipped a coin, it landed on tails, so we're attempting remake-in-place... again xD

[3a] Coding it Again
    [ ] Create Vite React app (ts)
    [ ] Add React Router
    [ ] Install Shadcn CLI
    [ ] Start re-coding from scratch

*[3b] Remaking in Place
    [X] Test as-is
    [ ] Strip unnecessary deps
    [ ] Remove react-scripts and other unnecessary deps
    [ ] Test
    [ ] Update deps that can be updated
        [ ] Test after each update
    [ ] Install Shadcn CLI
    [ ] Start Replacing nextui components one by one, with Shadcn components
    [ ] Remove nextui as a dep
